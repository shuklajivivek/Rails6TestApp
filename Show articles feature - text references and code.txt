Show articles feature - text references and code
You can find all the code added for the show feature for our articles resource here: https://github.com/udemyrailscourse/alpha-blog-6/commit/7304bca894202f78535b4abdc870d42f6a254967

Show actions are usually used to display individual items in a resource. For example:

- a specific article from an articles table

- a specific user's profile from a social media app

- details of a specific stock from a stocks table

- a specific recipe from a list of recipes

The steps are to -

1) Have a route for it

2) Have the corresponding controller/action that the route directs the request to

3) Have a corresponding view to display to the user who makes the request

The code details for each step are in the link provided at the beginning of this text resource. As a reminder: the red highlighted area are removals and the green highlighted area are additions.
